# Clean Up

CleanUp is an application that makes it easy for the employer to allocate, track and administrate tasks to employees working on ground level.

The app authenticates users and fetches tasks along with their location from our website using Rest Api. The users can upload the image back to the server when the task is complete and can mark it done.

This would help the employer to better administer and distribute tasks among the employees and reduce corruption.
